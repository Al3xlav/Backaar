## Backaar

`Backaar` is the library that is need for [`Backremlib`](https://github.com/Scrip00/Selfie-segmentation-library), because it includes custom [portrait_segmentation graph](https://github.com/Scrip00/Selfie-segmentation-library/tree/main/mediapipe/graphs/portrait_segmentation) and [background_masking_calculator](https://github.com/Scrip00/Selfie-segmentation-library/blob/main/mediapipe/calculators/image/background_masking_calculator.cc).

`Backaar.aar` should be imported into the Backremlib in module `build.gradle` file to make the library work.

More information about `backaar` is [here](https://github.com/Scrip00/Selfie-segmentation-library).
